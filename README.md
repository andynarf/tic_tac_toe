# Tic Tac Toe

This is the third project of the Main Ruby curriculum at Microverse .

*Tic-Tac -Toe involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.*

**GAME RULES**

- Two players are needed to play this game .
   The games asks both players to enter their names. The first player is assigned the mark “X” and the second player is assigned the mark “O”.

- The Game is played on a board , represented by a 3 squares by 3 squares grid , each one represented by a number ranging from 1 to 9 .

- Players take turns to select a position in the respective board, using the position’s respective number. After each move, the board will be displayed with the updated player position.

- If a value greater than "9" , or a cell that has already been selected before is entered when prompted, the player will be notified that this is an invalid move, and they will be asked to enter a valid one.

- The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
